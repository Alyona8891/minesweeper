# Minesweeper

You are to implement a classic game â€” [Minesweeper](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)>)

### Game rules

`In the game, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: unopened, opened and flagged. An unopened cell is blank and clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged cells are unopened cells marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location; some implementations make flagged cells inoperable to reduce the risk of uncovering a suspected mine. A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a mined cell, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or "0"), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be opened. Players can also flag a cell, visualized by a flag being put on the location, to denote that they believe a mine to be in that place.`

### Main functional requirements

`Basic (required):`

- initially, `body` in the index.html file must be empty (only script tag is allowed), **all necessary elements are generated using JS**
- the design should be adaptive (or responsive) from _(500px <= width)_. It is acceptable to change the appearance for the mobile version (for example, hide the buttons in the burger menu)
- the default size of the frame is 10x10 with 10 mines.
- the player should be able to click on cells to reveal them. If the cell contains a mine, the game is over. If the cell does not contain a mine, the number of mines in the surrounding cells should be displayed
- the game should end when the player reveals all cells that do not contain mines (win) or clicks on mine (lose). On a successful game solution, display the message: "Hooray! You found all mines in ## seconds and N moves!" or "Game over. Try again"

`Advanced:`

- mines are placed after the first move, so that user cannot lose the game on the first move
- the player should be able to flag cells to indicate that they suspect a mine is present
- the game should use color coding (using numbers and colors) to indicate the number of mines surrounding a revealed cell.
- the game can be restarted without reloading the page (for example, by clicking on button `New game`)
- display the game duration seconds and the number of clicks
- when user opens a square that does not touch any mines, it will be empty and the adjacent squares will automatically open in all directions until reaching squares that contain numbers

`Additional (to get extra points):`

- the game should include sound effects for events such as revealing a cell, flagging a cell, and game over (win and lose).
- the player should be able to select a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which changes the size of the game board and the number of mines
- the latest 10 results are saved in the high score table and can be viewed in any way (for example, by pressing a button)
- implement the functionality to save the game (for example, using localStorage), so that when the page is reloaded, a player can continue from where he left off
- dark/light themes of the game
